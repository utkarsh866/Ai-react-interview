# Production Fixes for AI Mock Interview

This guide provides solutions for fixing the sign-in and generate functionality in the production environment.

## Overview of Fixes

We've made several important changes to ensure the application works correctly in production:

1. **Authentication Handling**: Updated to work in both development and production environments
2. **Environment Detection**: Improved detection of mock vs. real credentials
3. **Firebase Configuration**: Enhanced to handle connectivity issues
4. **Error Handling**: Added better error handling and fallbacks

## Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to deploy the fixed version:

1. **Build the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build:prod
   ```

2. **Create Netlify _redirects File**:
   ```bash
   echo "/* /index.html 200" > dist/_redirects
   ```

3. **Deploy to Your Hosting Platform**:
   - For Netlify: `netlify deploy --prod`
   - For Vercel: `vercel --prod`
   - For Firebase: `firebase deploy --only hosting`

## Environment Variables

Make sure your production environment has these variables set correctly:

```
# Clerk Authentication
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_actual_clerk_key

# Firebase Configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_actual_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id

# Google Gemini API
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

### Sign-In Problems

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for authentication-related errors
2. **Verify Clerk Configuration**: Ensure your Clerk domain is allowed in the Clerk dashboard
3. **Try Mock Authentication**: If Clerk isn't working, the application will fall back to mock authentication

### Generate Route Issues

1. **Check Firebase Rules**: Ensure your Firestore security rules allow read/write operations
2. **Verify Firebase Configuration**: Double-check all Firebase environment variables
3. **Check Network Tab**: Look for any API or database connection errors

## Testing the Deployment

After deploying, test these key functionalities:

1. **Authentication**:
   - Sign up with a new account
   - Sign in with an existing account
   - Sign out and verify redirection

2. **Generate Functionality**:
   - Create a new mock interview
   - View existing interviews
   - Start and complete an interview

## Monitoring

Consider adding monitoring to track any issues:

1. **Firebase Analytics**: Enable Firebase Analytics to track user behavior
2. **Error Logging**: Use a service like Sentry to capture and report errors
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Enable performance monitoring in your hosting platform

## Support

If you continue to experience issues, please:

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Review the Firebase and Clerk documentation
3. Contact the development team with detailed information about the problem
